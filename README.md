/opt/projects — spotlight

- api-fusion: A typed REST + GraphQL starter (tRPC vibes) with JWT auth and Dockerized dev.
- taskwave: Minimalist task app with offline-first sync and optimistic UI (Next + Mongo).
- green-calc: Carbon footprint helper with PWA support and shareable insights.

Tip: pin your repos so these show above the fold.
